			<h3>Understanding how profit sharing works</h3>
			<img src="media_2.2.1-SNAPSHOT/profitsharing/pen.png" width="320" height="200" />
			<p>What if you could turn your efforts into money, with a little help from us? Yes, <em>we will share</em> the returns of the investments made with your algorithm.</p>
			<p>Your strategy is selected? We will enter into a contract where we have use of the strategy for an agreed period of time. We do not own the strategy, you do.
			We simply invest on it. Once the contract expires, we will stop using the strategy.</p>

			<h3>Sharing our profits with you</h3>
			<img src="media_2.2.1-SNAPSHOT/profitsharing/share_of_profits.png" width="292" height="162" />
			
			<p>We are in a position to raise substantial amounts of money from institutional investors. If selected, the initial allocation to your strategy would range between
			$100K and $10M. This allocation will often be increased if the strategy is proven solid.</p>
			<p>Your cut of profits will be 10%. We get paid by charging a fee on top of your cut to investors, with the vast
			majority of the performance being returned to them.</p>

			<h3>Estimating your share: an example</h3>

			<p>Matt is a quant that has fine-tuned one of the best strategies on Algodeal's system.</p>
			<p>After discussing with Matt, Algodeal decides to allocate $1 million on it to start with. At the end of the first year, the return is a solid $100,000. 10% of the profits are given to Matt: $10,000.</p>
			<p>Because the strategy has been proven reliable, Algodeal invests $10 millions the following year. The return this time is $1,200,000. Matt gets the same portion of these higher profits: $120,000.</p>
