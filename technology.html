		<h3>Our Grid</h3>
		<p>Algodeal's simulation infrastructure is based on a privately managed grid of high performance servers.
		We run thousands of backtests simultaneously and deliver the results directly to you.
		You can run your own strategy simulations in parallel to greatly accelerate strategy development.</p>
	
		<h3>Proximity Hosting</h3>
		<p>We entered into a special partnership with the ultra-low latency market data, proximity hosting &amp; exchange connectivity provider <a href="http://www.quanthouse.com/">QuantHouse</a>
		in order to get the fastest possible access to the market. We make sure our algo trading applications receive market data and send orders before everyone. 
		We understand the need for end-to-end ultra-low latency and use QuantHouse's Proximity Hosting services located as close to the exchanges as possible.</p>
		
		<h3>Order Routing System</h3>
		<p>We use QuantHouse's extensive network for our Order Routing System. We are connected to major financial centers around the world with extra low latency connectivity,
